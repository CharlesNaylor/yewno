# Yewno Quantitative Finance Assignment

I'll be looking at three questions as assigned in a PDF given to me. I plan to do some exploratory analysis in either RStudio or Jupyter notebooks which I'll compile to html and include in this repository. Throughout the assignment I'm going to avoid using for-pay data, which may limit the practical usefulness of the results.
